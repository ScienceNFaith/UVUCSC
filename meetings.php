      <h3>Social Events</h3>
      <p>Throughout the year, we hold social events such as ###########################################################. We regularly host a study break or Christmas party after classes end. In the past study breaks, we have had activities such as cookie decorating contest, gift exchange, video games, trivia, prizes and swag giveaways. We also host a LAN Party at least once a semester.</p>

      <h3>Industry Speakers</h3>
      <p>One of our goals, as a club, is to get you hired in the field. To accomplish that we will periodically bring in people connected to the CyberSecurity circles in Utah and around the world. This will give you a chance to meet and learn from them. We hope to help you build a network of people who can help you land a job in the field. Be sure to join the our club mailing list for announcements regarding these events.</p>

      <h3>CTF Team Events</h3>
      <p>UVU CyberSecurity has an open Capture the Flag Team for anyone who wants to participate. We'll be having weekly meetings, in addition to the club meetings, to prepare ourselves to compete in CTFs throughout the world</p>
      <p>It's simple: If you really want to dig deep into the world of hacking as a sport, this is where you want to be. Every year we'll be attending <a href="https://www.saintcon.org/">SAINTCON</a> to compete.</p>

      <h3>DefCon</h3>
      <p>Every year we go to <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">Defcon</a> as a club. Defcon usually takes place in the month of August. This is the highlight of the year for our club. In order to cut down on costs, our club will host a Fundraiser and split the funds between those who helped. We'll also help coordinate rides, hotels, anything you can think of to help everyone attend.</p> 
      <p>Don't miss this! For more info, talk to one of our <a href="officers">officers</a>.</p>
